# Proof Assistants

- automated theorem provers：给出命题自动证明
- proof assistant：辅助证明

# coq

- a platform for modeling programming languages: LLVM, C
- an environment for developing formally certified software and hardware: CompCert (Compiler for C), CertiKos (hypervisor), RISC-V processor
- a realistic environment for functional programming with dependent types: the Ynot system (embed "relational Hoare reasoning")
- a proof assistant for high-order logic （四色问题）

# the Advantages of Functional Programming

- computation is pure (no side effect)
- easier to understand and reason about
- easier to parallelize
